                <p>The fella you see to the right of this text is me- Oskars. Im a UXD student in De Haagse Hogeschool in Den Haag, Netherlands. I don't really like to talk about myself too much so im going to keep this description of myself short.</p>
                <p>I was born in Riga, Latvia in 1997. I knew I wanted to do something artistic in my life already in middleschool, so thats why I decided to sudy arts in my high school years. First I thaught architecture but as i don't relly enjoy maths and physics i abandoned that goal. Thats when idea about design studies was born. But why UXD exactly? I dont know to be honest. I liked the name, I liked the idea of doing designs and it seemed interesting to me to know how to research my targt group, not just make some random designs nobody would relate to. Does that make sense?</p>
